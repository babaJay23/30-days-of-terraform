## Day 27: Compliance as Code

Welcome to Day 27 of the 30 Days of Terraform challenge! Today, we'll dive into the concept of "Compliance as Code." In modern infrastructure management, ensuring compliance with security policies and regulatory standards is crucial. Terraform can help you achieve compliance by representing your infrastructure requirements as code.

### What is Compliance as Code?

Compliance as Code (CaC) is the practice of codifying compliance requirements and checks into your infrastructure provisioning process. By doing this, you can ensure that your infrastructure always adheres to the desired security, regulatory, and operational standards.

Terraform, combined with other tools like InSpec or Sentinel, can help you automate and enforce compliance checks on your infrastructure.

### Using Sentinel for Policy Enforcement

Sentinel is HashiCorp's policy-as-code framework that allows you to define and enforce policies across your infrastructure. It integrates seamlessly with Terraform, enabling you to implement custom policies and checks before applying changes to your infrastructure.

Here's an example of a simple Sentinel policy that enforces the use of encrypted Amazon S3 buckets:

```hcl
import "tfplan"

# Check for unencrypted S3 buckets
main = rule {
  all tfplan.resources.aws_s3_bucket as _, instances {
    all instances as _, r {
      r.server_side_encryption_configuration.0.rule {
        type = "AES256"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Incorporating Compliance Checks

As part of your Terraform workflow, you can use Sentinel to ensure that your infrastructure remains compliant with your organization's policies. This provides an extra layer of validation before any changes are applied.

By incorporating compliance checks, you enhance security, reduce manual audit efforts, and help prevent misconfigurations that could lead to security breaches.

### Challenge

Your challenge for today is to implement a Sentinel policy that enforces a specific compliance requirement in your Terraform configuration. Choose a simple compliance check, such as ensuring that all AWS EC2 instances are tagged with a specific tag key and value.

Write the Sentinel policy, test it against your Terraform configuration, and observe how Sentinel prevents non-compliant changes from being applied.

By completing this challenge, you'll gain hands-on experience with using Sentinel for compliance enforcement and learn how to ensure that your infrastructure adheres to your organization's policies.

Tomorrow, we'll explore the integration of monitoring and logging into your Terraform-managed infrastructure.

Keep up the fantastic work and happy coding! üõ°Ô∏èüöÄ
