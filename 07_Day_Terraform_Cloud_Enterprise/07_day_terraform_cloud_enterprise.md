# 30 Days of Terraform: Day 7

## Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise

Welcome to Day 7 of the **30 Days of Terraform** challenge! In the previous lesson, we covered modularization and remote state management. Today, we'll dive into **Terraform Cloud** and **Terraform Enterprise**, which provide powerful features for managing your infrastructure deployments.

### Introducing Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise

Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise are HashiCorp's solutions for managing Terraform deployments at scale. They offer numerous benefits, including:

- **Collaboration**: Multiple team members can collaborate on Terraform configurations in a centralized and controlled environment.
- **Remote Execution**: Execute Terraform runs remotely, freeing up local resources and enabling consistent runs across teams.
- **Policy Enforcement**: Apply governance and policy checks to ensure compliance and security standards are met.
- **Workspace Management**: Organize configurations into workspaces, allowing different environments and configurations to be managed separately.
- **VCS Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with version control systems (VCS) like GitHub, enabling CI/CD pipelines and automated workflows.
- **State Management**: Centralized state storage and locking mechanism to prevent concurrent modifications.

### Key Concepts

Let's explore some key concepts of Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise:

1. **Workspaces**: Workspaces are isolated environments where you manage your Terraform configurations. Each workspace has its own state, variables, and settings.

2. **Runs**: A run is an execution of Terraform configuration. It can be initiated manually or triggered automatically, such as in response to a code commit.

3. **State Management**: Terraform Cloud/Enterprise provides centralized state storage and locking. This ensures safe concurrent runs and allows historical state tracking.

4. **Policy Enforcement**: Define policies that must be satisfied before a run is allowed to proceed. This can include security checks, compliance rules, and more.

### Getting Started

To get started with Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise:

1. **Sign Up**: Create an account on Terraform Cloud (for the free tier) or set up Terraform Enterprise if you have an enterprise license.

2. **Create a Workspace**: Set up a workspace for your project. Link it to your version control repository.

3. **Configure Variables**: Define variables specific to the workspace, such as API keys, passwords, etc.

4. **Initiate Runs**: Trigger a run manually to apply your Terraform configuration. Observe the run's progress and output.

5. **Policy Checks**: Implement policy checks to enforce standards and best practices in your deployments.

### Your Task

For today's challenge, let's take the first steps in using Terraform Cloud or Terraform Enterprise:

1. **Sign Up**: If you haven't already, sign up for Terraform Cloud or set up Terraform Enterprise.

2. **Create a Workspace**: Set up a workspace for a sample project. Connect it to a version control repository containing Terraform code.

3. **Variables**: Define variables for your workspace, including any sensitive information.

4. **Run Your Configuration**: Initiate a run for your workspace and observe the process.

5. **Explore Policies (Optional)**: If using Terraform Enterprise, experiment with policy enforcement for your workspace.

### Conclusion

Congratulations on completing Day 7 of the challenge! You've now been introduced to Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise, powerful tools for managing Terraform deployments at scale. These tools will help you collaborate efficiently, enforce policies, and ensure the successful deployment of your infrastructure.

Tomorrow, we'll explore strategies for managing secrets and sensitive data in your Terraform projects.
