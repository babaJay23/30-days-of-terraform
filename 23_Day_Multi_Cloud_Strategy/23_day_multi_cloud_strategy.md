## Day 23: Terraform and Multi-Cloud Strategy

In today's lesson, we'll explore the concept of a multi-cloud strategy and how Terraform can help you manage infrastructure across multiple cloud providers. Utilizing multiple cloud providers can provide increased redundancy, better performance, and reduced vendor lock-in.

### Multi-Cloud Architecture

A multi-cloud strategy involves using services from more than one cloud provider, such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, simultaneously. This strategy provides several benefits:

1. **Redundancy:** Deploying resources across multiple cloud providers reduces the risk of downtime due to provider-specific issues.
2. **Performance Optimization:** Different cloud providers may offer better performance for specific workloads or regions.
3. **Vendor Lock-In Mitigation:** By avoiding complete reliance on a single cloud provider, you can reduce the risk of being locked into their ecosystem.

### Terraform for Multi-Cloud

Terraform's declarative approach to infrastructure as code makes it well-suited for managing multi-cloud deployments. You can define resources from different cloud providers within the same configuration files.

Here's an example of provisioning resources across AWS and Azure:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

resource "azurerm_virtual_machine" "example" {
  name                  = "my-vm"
  location              = "East US"
  resource_group_name   = "my-resource-group"
  network_interface_ids = [azurerm_network_interface.example.id]
  vm_size               = "Standard_DS1_v2"
}
```

In this example, we're using both the `aws` and `azurerm` providers to define resources on AWS and Azure within the same Terraform configuration.

### Challenge

Your challenge for today is to create a multi-cloud Terraform configuration that provisions resources on at least two different cloud providers. Document the process, including how you set up providers, defined resources, and managed cross-cloud interactions.

As an advanced task, you could explore creating a load balancer that distributes traffic across instances deployed on different cloud providers.

Remember, a multi-cloud strategy should be chosen carefully based on your application's requirements and architecture.

Great work! Tomorrow, we'll explore Terraform's role in achieving immutable infrastructure.
