## Day 20: Infrastructure as Code Design Patterns

As your infrastructure grows and becomes more complex, it's important to adopt design patterns that help you manage, scale, and organize your Terraform code. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) design patterns provide best practices and guidelines for structuring your codebase to achieve modularity, reusability, and maintainability.

### Module Design Pattern

The **Module Design Pattern** involves breaking down your infrastructure code into reusable and self-contained modules. Each module encapsulates a specific set of resources or functionality. This design pattern promotes code reuse, simplifies maintenance, and enables you to manage complex infrastructure configurations more effectively.

Consider a scenario where you are provisioning an application stack that consists of a web server and a database server. Instead of defining all resources in a single configuration file, you can create separate modules for the web server and the database server. This separation allows you to manage each component independently and reuse them in other projects.

### Composite Design Pattern

The **Composite Design Pattern** enables you to create higher-level abstractions by combining multiple lower-level components or modules. This pattern is useful for managing infrastructure that follows a consistent structure across multiple environments, such as development, testing, and production.

For example, you can create a composite module that combines the web server and database server modules mentioned earlier. This composite module can include additional resources like load balancers, security groups, and networking components. By using the composite pattern, you can provision entire application stacks with a single module invocation.

### Template Design Pattern

The **Template Design Pattern** involves creating generic templates that can be parameterized and reused across different projects. Templates allow you to define common infrastructure configurations and customize them by providing specific inputs.

For instance, you can create a template for provisioning a Kubernetes cluster with configurable parameters such as node count, instance types, and Kubernetes version. By using templates, you streamline the process of creating similar infrastructure configurations with minimal duplication.

### Example: Module Design Pattern

Let's illustrate the Module Design Pattern by refactoring our previous example. Assume you have separate modules for a web server (`web_server`) and a database server (`database_server`), each defined in their respective directories (`modules/web_server` and `modules/database_server`).

Your main configuration (`main.tf`) can then reference these modules:

```hcl
module "web" {
  source = "./modules/web_server"
  // Input variables for web module
}

module "db" {
  source = "./modules/database_server"
  // Input variables for database module
}
```

### Challenge

Your challenge for today is to refactor your existing Terraform configuration to adopt one of the design patterns discussed: Module, Composite, or Template. Choose a pattern that aligns with your infrastructure needs and apply it to your codebase. Document your design choices and the benefits you gained from using the selected pattern.

Remember to update your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to ensure that your refactored configuration continues to work seamlessly within your CI/CD pipeline.

Design patterns are powerful tools that help you architect robust and maintainable infrastructure. Embrace the pattern that best fits your project's requirements!

That wraps up Day 20! Tomorrow, we'll delve into the integration of Terraform with Kubernetes.
