## Day 22: Terraform and Serverless Architecture

Serverless architecture allows developers to build and deploy applications without managing traditional server infrastructure. Terraform can be used to define and manage serverless resources, such as AWS Lambda functions, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions. In this lesson, we'll explore how to leverage Terraform to provision and manage serverless resources.

### Provisioning a Serverless Function

To provision a serverless function using Terraform, you'll typically use a cloud provider-specific provider and resource definitions. Let's walk through an example of provisioning an AWS Lambda function using Terraform.

Create a file named `main.tf`:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_lambda_function" "example_function" {
  function_name = "my-lambda-function"
  handler      = "index.handler"
  runtime      = "nodejs14.x"
  s3_bucket    = "my-bucket"
  s3_key       = "lambda/my-function.zip"
}
```

In this example, we're using the `aws` provider to interact with AWS. We define an `aws_lambda_function` resource with a function name, handler, runtime, and other relevant configurations.

### Managing Serverless Resources

Terraform allows you to define and manage various serverless resources, such as functions, triggers, and permissions, as code. For instance, you can define the event source mappings and permissions required for your serverless function to interact with other resources.

```hcl
resource "aws_lambda_event_source_mapping" "example_mapping" {
  event_source_arn = aws_dynamodb_table.example_stream.arn
  function_name   = aws_lambda_function.example_function.function_name
  starting_position = "LATEST"
}
```

In this example, we're using the `aws_lambda_event_source_mapping` resource to create an event source mapping between an AWS Lambda function and a DynamoDB table stream.

### Challenge

Your challenge for today is to provision a serverless function on your chosen cloud provider using Terraform and manage a simple serverless resource, such as an AWS Lambda function or an Azure Function. Document the process, including how you integrated Terraform with your serverless architecture and the advantages of defining serverless resources as code.

As an advanced task, you could explore setting up triggers and permissions for your serverless function to interact with other resources, such as databases or message queues.

Serverless architecture combined with Terraform's Infrastructure as Code capabilities can streamline the deployment and management of serverless applications.

Great job! Tomorrow, we'll delve into the strategy of utilizing multiple cloud providers using Terraform.
